# AI Voice Assistant

A Python-based desktop voice assistant that performs tasks using speech recognition and text-to-speech.
This is a simple Ai based assistant where it can be accessed in windows(But i didn't tried in mac book😅).
Although it runs fine in windows.If any issue,please get it to me because it was built based on my own idea.
